# D.E.X.T

Created a decentraized blockchain based website to facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading
without intermediaries using Solidity, EthersJS and ReactJs.
Developed smart contract using Solidity, deployed it on Ganache testnet via Hardhat. Used the
obtained ABI and contract address to link the contract to Frontend part using EtherJs library.
